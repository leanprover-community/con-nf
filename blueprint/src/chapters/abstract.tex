\begin{abstract}
  We give a self-contained account of a version of the proof of Holmes and Wilshaw \cite{con-nf} that Quine's set theory \emph{New Foundations} \cite{quine-nf} is consistent relative to the metatheory ZFC.
  This version of the proof is written in a style that is particularly amenable to the formalisation in Lean \cite{leanprover-community-con-nf}; to that end, type-theoretic concerns and dependencies between parts of the proof are explicitly spelled out.
